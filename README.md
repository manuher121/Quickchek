# Quickchek
Trying to replicate the ordering system from Quickchek(Work in progress)
This a project i decided to create to help me learn more and code more.
The concept or idea is to create three diferent screens, one for ordering (with custom orders made by customer), another screen to show the order so that an employee can know how to make the custom order and a third screen to pay the order while also having the ability to pay for other products already in inventory.
For now i already have the first screen made, with options and a GUI(I am working on learning a little of photoshop to make it even better).
Currently working on screen number two.
